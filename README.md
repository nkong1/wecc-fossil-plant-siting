Hello there! 

Before continuing, please note that the data in this folder is still a work in progress. It will be updated soon. 

Techno-economic parameters for each hydrogen production technology can be found in the h2_plant_parameters.xlsx file and the prod_tech_info_yearly folder. All constant parameters, except those for emissions factors, are located in the excel file. A more detailed breakdown of these parameters for each technology can be found in the aforementioned folder. These parameters are indexed by year. 

The emissions factors data is found in the 'h2_prod_tech_emissions_factors csv'. 
  
Documentation for all parameters can be found in the documentation doc.
  
Each technology has been added to the SWITCH input files (located in SWITCH_projects). Candidate plants with CAP emissions are not included in Mexico or Canada. Candidate coal plants are not included in California. The list of candidate projects is for the year 2050 (uses 2050 parameters).
